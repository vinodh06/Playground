// Index Set
//IndexSet represents a set of positive integer values. You can, of course, do this with a Set<Int>, but IndexSet is more storage efficient because it uses a list of ranges internally. Say you have a table view with 1,000 elements and you want to use a set to manage the indices of the rows the user has selected. A Set<Int> needs to store up to 1,000 elements, depending on how many rows are selected. An IndexSet, on the other hand, stores continuous ranges, so a selection of the first 500 rows in the table only takes two integers to store (the selectionâ€™s lower and upper bounds).
var indices = IndexSet()
indices.insert(integersIn: 1..<5)
indices.insert(integersIn: 11..<15)
let evenIndices = indices.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 } // [2, 4, 12, 14]
