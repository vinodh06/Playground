 # Error Handling.
 
 *Error handling* is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in your program.
 
 Swift provides first-class support for throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.
 
 Optionals are used to represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it’s often useful to understand what caused the failure, so that your code can respond accordingly.
 */


/*:
 ## Representing and Throwing Errors
 In Swift, errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol. This empty protocol indicates that a type can be used for error handling.
 
 Swift enumerations are particularly well suited to modeling a group of related error conditions, with associated values allowing for additional information about the nature of an error to be communicated. For example, here’s how you might represent the error conditions of operating a vending machine inside a game:
 */

enum VendingMachineError: Error {
    case invalidSelection
    case insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: Int)
    case outOfStock
}
/*:
 ## Handling Erros
 **There are four ways to handle errors in Swift -**
 + You can propagate the error from a function to the code that calls that function
 + handle the error using a do-catch statement
 + handle the error as an optional value
 + assert that the error will not occur
 */

/*:
 ## Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions
To indicate that a function, method, or initializer can throw an error, you write the throws keyword in the function’s declaration after its parameters. A function marked with throws is called a throwing function. If the function specifies a return type, you write the throws keyword before the return arrow (->).

 #Specifying Cleanup Actions
 You use a *defer* statement to execute a set of statements just before code execution leaves the current block of code. This statement lets you do any necessary cleanup that should be performed regardless of how execution leaves the current block of code—whether it leaves because an error was thrown or because of a statement such as return or break. For example, you can use a defer statement to ensure that file descriptors are closed and manually allocated memory is freed.
